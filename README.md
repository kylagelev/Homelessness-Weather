# Question: What is the relationship between weather and homelessness in the top 20 largest metropolitan cities?

Initially, we will collect the top 20 metropolitan cities, and draw data on the total homeless population based on the county that they preside in from the years 2014 to 2015. This data will come from a csvfile and be presented using a bar graph for each county.

Homelessness per capita will then be calculated using total homeless individuals over total population of selected the respective county.

Following this, we will use a weather csvfile, and draw data on the temperatures of 01/01/2014 and 01/01/2015. We will compare the difference in temperatures and total homeless per capita in a scatterplot and see if there is significant correlation between these two factors. We will also represent the data using a geomap. The overlying colors and intensity will indicate areas of high correlation.

Afterwards, we will utilize the homelessness per capita once again and compare it to the growth in population per county from 2014 to 2015. This will once again be compared together onto a scatterplot as well as geomap where correlation will be assessed.
